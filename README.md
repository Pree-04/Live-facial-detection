# Image-Transformation
Applying Geometrical Transformations On An Image.
This project demonstrates various geometrical transformations applied to images using OpenCV, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries. The transformations covered include translation, scaling, rotation, and converting grayscale images to color.

## Features

- **Translation**: Shifts the image along the X and Y axes.
- **Scaling**: Changes the size of the image.
- **Rotation**: Rotates the image by a specified angle.
- **Grayscale to Color Conversion**: Converts grayscale images to color images.

## Libraries Used

- **OpenCV**: For performing image processing and transformations.
- **Matplotlib**: For displaying images.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip.
